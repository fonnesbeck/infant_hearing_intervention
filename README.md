# Analysis of early interventions for children with hearing loss

Purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between highly qualified providers, age of enrollment in intervention, and speech and language outcomes in groups of children enrolled in school programs that specialize in the development of listening and spoken language.

## Primary aims

1. Does identification by 3 months and intervention by 6 months result in improve educational outcomes?
2. Does OPTION intervention result in marginally better outcomes than generic intervention?

> All studies with successful outcomes reported for early-identified children who are deaf or hard of hearing have intervention provided by specialists who are trained in parent-infant intervention services.[12,90,97] Early intervention programs should develop mechanisms to ensure that early intervention professionals have special skills necessary for providing families with the highest quality of service specific to children with hearing loss. Professionals with a background in deaf education, audiology, and speech-language pathology will typically have the skills needed for providing intervention services. Professionals should be highly qualified in their respective fields and should be skilled communicators who are knowledgeable and sensitive to the importance of enhancing families' strengths and supporting their priorities. When early intervention professionals have knowledge of the principles of adult learning, it increases their success with parents and other professionals.
